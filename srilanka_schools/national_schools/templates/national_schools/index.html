        <h2>School Education System in Sri Lanka</h2>
        <h3>Overview of the School Administrative System</h3>
        <p>The education system in Sri Lanka is centrally managed by the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Education</a>, which sets national policies, curricula, and examination standards. Below the ministry, provincial education ministries oversee implementation at the regional level through Provincial Departments of Education. Each province is divided into Zonal Education Offices, which supervise schools within their zones. Furthermore, under each zonal education level there are divisional level education offices to ease the administrative procedures. At the school level, principals and school management committees handle day-to-day operations. This hierarchical structure ensures centralized policy with localized administration in the school education sector in Sri Lanka.</p>

        <h3>Categorization of schools</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka's school system includes a variety of institutions catering to different educational needs. There are government maintained or public schools, which are state-funded and widely accessible.Those are mainly focussing the national curriculum and use Sinhala or Tamil as the medium of instruction depending on the language that the majority uses. Some of the public schools facilitate for English medium eductaion as well. Private and international schools offer alternative curricula, such as Edexcel or Cambridge, and often use English as the medium of instruction.</p>
        <p>Public schools are further categorized as national and provincial schools based on the management perspective. National schools are managed by the central Ministry of Education whereas the provincial schools are overseen by provincial councils. These schools are further categorized into four main types as 1AB, 1C, Type 2, and Type 3 based on the highest grade offered and the availability of Advanced Level (A/L) subject streams. </p> <p>Additionally, the country has religious and special education institutions, including Buddhist Pirivenas, Christian Missionary Schools, Islamic Education Institutions and schools for children with disabilities, reflecting the systemâ€™s diversity and inclusivity.</p>

        <h4>National Schools in Sri Lanka</h4>
        <p>National schools constitute a distinct category within Sri Lanka's public education system, operating under the direct administration and funding of the central Ministry of Education. Unlike provincial schools, they are governed by a centralized authority, which facilitates the implementation of uniform national standards and policies. These institutions are widely recognized for their commitment to academic excellence, often possessing superior infrastructure, advanced educational resources, and a broader range of extracurricular facilities.</p><p>Admission to a national school is very competitive. Entry is usually decided by how well a student performs in national exams, especially the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination for those hoping to get into Grade 6. The whole purpose of the national school system is to provide a high-quality education and equal opportunities to students in every district, playing a key role in improving the nation's educational standards.</p><p>This aim of this education dashboard is to vizualize the distribution of national schools in Sri Lanka. This interactive map serves as a detailed dashboard for exploring the national school network and the educational landscape of Sri Lanka. Using a comprehensive dataset of geocoded schools, the map accurately plots the precise location of each national school across the country. <p>You can use the filtering system to explore schools based on various administrative divisions, including Provinces, Districts, Education Zones, and Education Divisions. Clicking on any school marker will display a popup with detailed information, such as the school's address, province, district, education zone, education division and the type and medium of instruction.</p>
